# README

1. In the terminal, navigate to a projects folder and clone the client with: `git clone git@github.com:briandangerflynn/trip-manager-api.git`
2. `cd` into the app and run the following:
  - bundle install
  - rails db:create
  - rails db:migrate
  - rails db:seed
3. start the server with `rails s`. Make sure to do this **before** starting the client server, so that the url endpoints are properly aligned.
